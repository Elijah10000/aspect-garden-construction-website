			<h2> Where We Serve </h2>

		</div>
		
		<div class="boxEight"> 
			<h5> Aspect serves all across Ireland. From where we're based, in Dublin, all the way to Galway, Clare and Donegal. Some of our best work has been outside of Dublin, so if you fear that it's going to be an inconvenience, fear no more! You just have to let us know 3 months in advance so we can check the site for any potential obstacles and to give us time to make mock-ups and to sort out essential man-managment. Once that is sorted out, we're good to go and planning can commence immediatly. Nobody is too far, though be warned, the further you are located, the more costly our services will be, due to transport fees and semi-perminent relocation of equipment and employees. Furthermore, if weather is too bad for work to continue, and if materials and equipment are destroyed in this process, the client must pay for repair or replacement.  </h5>
